        "Nutrition of women with hair loss problem during the period of menopause",
      author: "Zuzanna Sabina Goluch-Koniuszy",
      text: `During the period of menopause as an effect of changes in hormone status, one of the most common ailments
       for women is hair loss. Taking into consideration fact that the ingredients of diet contained in various groups of 
       consumed food products are both precursors in steroid hormones synthesis as well as have direct impact on structure,
        growth and keeping hair in skin integument, this is the reason why nourishing support for women during this period
        of life as well as during the hair loss therapy is reasonable.
        Standard value proteins containing Sulphur amino-acids: cysteine and methionine as precursor to keratin hair protein 
        synthesis are basic element of diet conditioning of hair building. Irreplaceable having impact on keeping hair in skin
        integument is exogenous L-lysine, mainly present in the inner part of hair root is responsible for hair shape and volume.
        Fats present in the diet take part in steroid hormones synthesis (from cholesterol) thus have influence on keeping hair
        in skin integument. Women diet should contain products rich in complex carbohydrates, with low glycemic index and load
        containing fiber regulating carbohydrate-lipid metabolism of the body. Vitamins also have impact on the state of hair: 
        C vitamin, group B and A vitamins. Minerals which influence hair growth are: Zn, Fe, Cu, Se, Si, Mg and Ca. It is worthwhile 
        to pay closer attention to diet in women who besides hormone changes and undertaken pharmacotherapy are additionally exposed 
        to chronic stress and improperly conducted cosmetic’s and hairdresser’s treatments.`,

      author:
        "Ana Maria Costa & Herbert Cavalcante de Lima & Lívia de Lacerda de Oliveira Pineli & Sonia & Maria Costa Celestino",
      text: `The aim of this work was to evaluate three process of the prepare of degreased flour of baru
            (Dipteryx alata Vog) with the intention of identifying those which provides products with the best
            quality in relation of ant-oxidant activity e and total contents of phenolics, flavonoids and
            anthocyanins. The effects of roasting of the skin of the almond were studied through the
            treatments: 1. Dehydration in forced air circles at 60°C with the taking out of the external skin of
            the almond: 2. Dehydration and roasting of the almond with the skin. 3. Dehydration and
            roasting of the almond without the skin. After each treatment, the flour were degreased through
            cold pressing and then stored under refrigeration. The treatment 2 provided contents from 3 to 4
            times higher than the others for both the ant-oxidant activity (180 µMol of trolox) and totals
            phenolics (average of 140 mg/100g), which indicates the increase of product quality by the
            presence of the skin during the roasting. However, the best result for flavonoids was found in
            the samples without the skin of the treatment 3. For anthocyanins, the best situation was found
            in the treatment without roasting. The result shows a significant effect of the initial processing of
            the degreased flour of baru. `,

        title: "Measuring and defining the experience of immersion in games",
        author:
        "Charlene Jennetta, Anna L.Coxa, Paul Cairnsb, Samira Dhopareec, Andrew Eppsc, Tim Tijsd, Alison Waltond",
        text: `Despite the word's common usage by gamers and reviewers alike, it is still not clear what immersion means. This paper explores immersion further by investigating whether immersion can be defined quantitatively, describing three experiments in total. The first experiment investigated participants’ abilities to switch from an immersive to a non-immersive task. The second experiment investigated whether there were changes in participants’ eye movements during an immersive task. The third experiment investigated the effect of an externally imposed pace of interaction on immersion and affective measures (state anxiety, positive affect, negative affect). Overall the findings suggest that immersion can be measured subjectively (through questionnaires) as well as objectively (task completion time, eye movements). Furthermore, immersion is not only viewed as a positive experience: negative emotions and uneasiness (i.e. anxiety) also run high.`,

      author:
      "George Wald",
      text: `1. Vitamin A has been found in the retinas and the combined pigment epithelia and choroid layers of frogs, pigs, sheep, and cattle. The vitamin was identified by (a) its specific absorption at 328 mµ; (b) the blue color yielded with antimony trichloride, associated with an absorption band at about 620 mµ; (c) anti-xerophthalmic and growth-promoting activity; and (d) quantitative relationships among the results of these three types of observation.

      2. The mammalian retinas contain about 22γ, the frog retinas about 400γ, and the frog pigmented layers almost 2 mg. of vitamin A per gram of dry tissue.
      
      3. With the possible exception of hepaxanthin, no other carotenoids were found in the mammalian tissues.`,
